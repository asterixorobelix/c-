/*
Write a program which picks a random number from 1-100. The user keeps guessing as long as their guess is wrong, and they've guessed less than 7 times. 
If their guess is higher than the number, say "Too high" if their guess is lower than the number, say "Too low". 
When they get it right, the game stops. Or, if they hit seven guesses, the game stops even if they never got it right. 

I am thinking of a number between 1-100. You have 7 guesses:
Guess #1:50
Too high
Guess #2:15
Too low
Guess #3:18
Correct. You won!
