What is the .Net framework?
The .NET framework is a shared library of code and a virtual machine runtime environment. A framework is basically code which you can use without explicitly defining the code's meaning.
For example, other classes can inherit from the IEnumerables interface, but this interface has been defined by others and I don't have to explicitly make this definition available.
What is a namespace?
A namespace is where the meaning of a term has been defined.

What is the definition of a parameter?

What does “var” mean in C#?
Local variables can be declared without giving an explicit type. The var keyword instructs the compiler to infer the type of the variable from the expression on the right side of the initialization statement. The inferred type may be a built-in type, an anonymous type, a user-defined type, or a type defined in the .NET Framework class library.
An implicitly typed local variable is strongly typed just as if you had declared the type yourself, but the compiler determines the type. The following two declarations of i are functionally equivalent:
var i = 10; // implicitly typed  
int i = 10; //explicitly typed  

var has only two uses:

It can be a minor convenience with complicated types. It requires less typing to declare variables, especially when declaring a variable as a nested generic type.
It is more important with anonymous types. It must be used when storing a reference to an object of an anonymous type, because the type name cannot be known in advance.
