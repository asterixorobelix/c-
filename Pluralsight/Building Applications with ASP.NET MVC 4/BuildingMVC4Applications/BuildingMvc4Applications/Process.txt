*****Setting up data project*****

Created data project
Installed Entity Framework for data project
Added data context class for entity framework to connect to db
In App.Config: Add your connection string, somewhere between the <configuration> tags. Eg:   
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDb)\MSSqlLocalDb;Initial Catalog=Data.DataContext;Integrated Security=True"
      providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>
db context should inherit from DbContext
Typed "Enable-Migrations" into the console
Created initial, blank migration by typing "Add-Migration InitialMigration" into console
Typed Update-Database into console. This created a database named: Data.Datacontext
Created Restaurant class
Added virtual property for Restaurants to DataContext class
Create Migration for your class by typing into the console: Add-Migration CreateRestaurantsTable
