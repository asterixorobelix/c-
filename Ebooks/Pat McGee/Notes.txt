Notice that fractional numeric values require a suffix of f to distinguish them as float types. Whole numbers can be assigned to float types because the float type is large enough to store any valid whole number.
eg: 
float cnTower = 553; //valid
float empireStateBuilding = 443.1; //invalid
float burjKhalifa = 829.3f; //valid

Regular Expressions
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that is used for pattern matching in strings. Regular expressions are often used to validate text inputs to ensure that the data conforms to the expected format. 
Most modern programming languages enable regular expressions since they offer such concise and efficient pattern searching. 
The C# regular expression library is defined in the System.Text.RegularExpressions namespace. Parsing and validation is enabled from this library with the Regex class. 
When initializing a Regex object to validate a string, the regular expression pattern is passed as a parameter:
Regex regex = new Regex(string regularExpression);

The Regex object provides an IsMatch() method to validate strings:
bool match = regex.IsMatch(string input);

The two primary C# types you need for manipulating dates and times are theTimeSpan type and the DateTime type. Both C# types are available through the System namespace.
The TimeSpan type stores and manages time interval components for blocks of time, ranging from ticks to milliseconds to days. While TimeSpan objects do not store or manage dates, they are especially helpful when calculating time intervals between dates.
