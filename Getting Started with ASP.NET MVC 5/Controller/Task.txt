For this task the controller will do the "VC" portion of MVC — that is, the view and controller work. 
The controller will return HTML directly. Ordinarily you don't want controllers returning HTML directly, since that becomes very cumbersome to code. 
Instead we'll typically use a separate view template file to help generate the HTML response. 
************
Create a controller class
Add an MVC 5 controller
Name your controller "HelloWorldController"
Create a method called Index, which prints "This is my default action in bold"
Run the app and browse to /HelloWorld/Welcome to check the output
Modify the example slightly so that you can pass some parameter information from the URL to the controller. In this case, pass a name and number of times to repeat printing the name
the URL segment should be passed as query strings
Create a parameter (ID) which matches the URL specification in the RegisterRoutes method. (passing parameters as route data)
