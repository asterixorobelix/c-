Create a Method called ReadValue, which can prompt the user to enter a value between a max and a min, with a configurable message.
ReadValue should keep on prompting the user until valid input is entered.

Sample Output:
Enter width of window:  between 0.5 an
4
Width: 4
Enter your age:  between 0 and 70
34
Age: 34

    // prompt for the user, low = lowest allowed value, high = highest allowed value

        double result = 0;
        do
        {

            string resultString = Console.ReadLine();
            result = double.Parse(resultString);
        } while ((result < low) || (result > high));
