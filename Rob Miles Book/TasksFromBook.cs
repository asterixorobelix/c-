Write a program which reads in the width and height (as doubles) of a  hole in the wall for a window.
The program should then print out the amount of wood required for the frame (in metres) and glass required to double glaze a window of that size.

Sample Output:
This program asks you for the width and height of a window and calculates the area of glass required to fill the hole
Enter width in metres:
2.3
Enter height in metres:
1.1
The length of the wood for the frame is: 6.8 metres
The area of glass required for double glazing is 5.06 square metres

Create a program which allows the user to enter 5 scores into an array. The program should check that the numbers are positive and less than 300. 
If not, do not add them to the array.
Display the valid entries after the user has entered 5 scores.

Sample Output:
You will be able to enter 5 scores
Score : -1
Score : 11
Score : 2
Score : 400
Score : 34
Score : 2
Score : 11
You entered:
