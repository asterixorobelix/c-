Define a new class, called Car, which holds a single variable, called color. Use a color property to access the color variable.
Create a constructor for your Car class, which takes a parameter which allows us to initialize Car objects with a color. 
Also create the Describe() method, which prints out the colour of a Car.
Create several Car objects and assign different colours to them.

Sample Output:
This car is Red
This car is Green

Create several Car objects and assign different colours to them.
The color variable will now be returned in uppercase characters, since we apply the ToUpper() method to it before returning it, and when we try to set the color, only the value "Red" will be accepted.

Sample Output:
This car is Red
This car is Green

Create a class called Vehicle.
Create a new vehicle object and run its ToString method to see the results. As we have not yet defined how ToString should work, this will simply show the fully qualified name.

Create a Rectangle class. Add two private integer variables to the Rectangle class to hold the height and width.
Add width and height properties.
For both the width and height properties, if the value is negative or is greater than one hundred, an exception will be thrown and the property will remain unchanged.
Create two objects based upon the Rectangle class, Rect and square.
Ask the user to input width and height for these two objects and print out the widths and heights for the two.
Add read-only properties for the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
Print out the area and perimeter of the two shapes. The "this" keyword does have another use. If a method is being called and the current object is to be passed to that method, setting a parameter to "this" achieves the desired result.
