Define a new class, called Car, which holds a single variable, called color. Use a color property to access the color variable.
Create a constructor for your Car class, which takes a parameter which allows us to initialize Car objects with a color. 
Also create the Describe() method, which prints out the colour of a Car.
Create several Car objects and assign different colours to them.

Sample Output:
This car is Red
This car is Green

Create a constructor for your Car class, which takes a parameter which allows us to initialize Car objects with a color. 
Also create the Describe() method, which prints out the colour of a Car.
Create several Car objects and assign different colours to them.

Also, make sure that the color variable will be returned in uppercase characters, since we apply the ToUpper() method to it

Sample Output:
This car is RED
This car is GREEN

Create a Rectangle class. Add two private integer variables to the Rectangle class to hold the height and width.
Add width and height properties.
For both the width and height properties, if the value is negative or is greater than one hundred, display an error message and the property will remain unchanged.
Create two objects based upon the Rectangle class, Rect and square.
Ask the user to input width and height for these two objects and print out the widths and heights for the two.
Add read-only properties for the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
Print out the area and perimeter of the two shapes. 

Sample Output:
Area:2500
Perimeter: 250

Square!
Area:625
Perimeter: 100

Create a new class to represent a triangular shape, called Triangle. This class will define three properties: the triangle's height, base-length and area.
In order to ensure that all triangles will have a height and base-length within the valid range, make the class's default constructor set both of these properties to one unit for all new Triangle objects.

Sample Output:
Triangle constructor executed
Area:   0,5

Create a class named 'MassCalculator', which multiplies density*volume. 
Provide a method which accepts the density and the volume of an item and calculates its mass. 
The class will also maintain a property which counts the number of times that the calculation has been performed. 

Sample Output:
Mass: 1288
Mass: 56781,12
Mass: 6621,12
Calculator has been used 3 times

Create a new class file named "Calculate"
Add a method called Square, which calculates the square of an integer value.
In order to support the double data type we can add a second variation of the method to the Calculate class. This overloaded method will accept and return doubles rather than integers. 

Sample Output:
Double Square calculated
25
Integer Square calculated
25
Double Square calculated
25
