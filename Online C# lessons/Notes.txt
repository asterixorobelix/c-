c# Tutorial

A variable can be compared to a storage room, and is essential for the programmer. In C#, a variable is declared like this: 
<data type> <name>; 

An example could look like this: 
string name; 

That's the most basic version. Usually, you wish to assign a visibility to the variable, and perhaps assign a value to it at the same time. It can be done like this: 
<visibility> <data type> <name> = <value>; 

And with an example:
private string name = "John Doe";

A function allows you to encapsulate a piece of code and call it from other parts of your code. You may very soon run into a situation where you need to repeat a piece of code, from multiple places, and this is where functions come in. In C#, they are basically declared like this:
<visibility> <return type> <name>(<parameters>)
{
	<function code>
}

The out modifier
The out modifier works pretty much like the ref modifier. They both ensure that the parameter is passed by reference instead of by value, but they do come with two important differences: A value passed to a ref modifier has to be initialized before calling the method - this is not true for the out modifier, where you can use un-initialized values. On the other hand, you can't leave a function call with an out parameter, without assigning a value to it. Since you can pass in un-initialized values as an out parameter, you are not able to actually use an out parameter inside a function - you can only assign a new value to it. 

The params modifier
So far, all of our functions have accepted a fixed amount of parameters. However, in some cases, you might need a function which takes an arbitrary number of parameters. By using the params keyword, you can specify a method parameter which takes a variable number of arguments.
You can send a comma-separated list of arguments of the type specified in the parameter declaration or an array of arguments of the specified type. You also can send no arguments. If you send no arguments, the length of the params list is zero.

Properties allow you to control the accessibility of a classes variables, and is the recommended way to access variables from the outside in an object oriented programming language like C#.
A property is much like a combination of a variable and a method - it can't take any parameters, but you are able to process the value before it's assigned to our returned. A property consists of 2 parts, a get and a set method.
Constructors are special methods, used when instantiating a class. A constructor can never return anything, which is why you don't have to define a return type for it. A normal method is defined like this:

public string Describe()
A constructor can be defined like this:
public Car()
A constructor can be overloaded as well, meaning we can have several constructors, with the same name, but different parameters. 

Encapsulation
Encapsulation,also known as data hiding, is an important object-oriented programming concept. It is the act of concealing the functionality of a class so that the internal operations are hidden, and irrelevant, to the programmer. With correct encapsulation, the developer does not need to understand how the class actually operates in order to communicate with it via its publicly available methods and properties; known as its public interface.
Encapsulation is essential to creating maintainable object-oriented programs. When the interaction with an object uses only the publicly available interface of methods and properties, the class of the object becomes a correctly isolated unit. This unit can then be replaced independently to fix bugs, to change internal behaviour or to improve functionality or performance.
In the real world, this is similar to replacing a lightbulb. As long as we choose the correct bulb size and connection (the public interface), it will work. It does not matter if the manufacturer is different or the internal workings of the bulb differ from the original. It may even offer an improvement in brightness!

Public methods are part of the class's public interface, ie. these are the methods that can be called by other objects.
To provide for encapsulation, where the internal functionality of the class is hidden, some methods will be defined as private. Methods with a private protection level are completely invisible to external classes.
To define a method as private, the private keyword can be used as a prefix to the method. Alternatively, using no prefix at all implies that the method is private by default.

To define a class-scoped variable, the declaration is made within the class's code block but outside of any methods or properties. Although not required, it is useful to precede the variable declaration with the private keyword to make the code clear and easy to read. 

A final keyword to consider is "this". The "this" keyword can be used within a class's code to refer to the current instantiated object. 
The "this" keyword does have another use. If a method is being called and the current object is to be passed to that method, setting a parameter to "this" achieves the desired result. 

In order to set properties, an object is instantiated and the property values are assigned individually. This gives the desired result but is not ideal as it is possible for a property to be forgotten and left undefined, possibly leaving the entire object in an invalid state. This problem is solved with the use of constructors.
A constructor is a special class member that is executed when a new object is created. The constructor's job is to initialise all of the public and private state of the new object and to perform any other tasks that the programmer requires before the object is used.
The syntax to add a new constructor to a class is similar to that of adding a method. However, the constructor has the same name as the class and does not include a return type.

Sometimes you will want to create behaviour that is not linked to any individual object, instead being available to all instances and to objects of other classes. This is where static members become useful.
Static methods are useful when creating functions that are not reliant on any instance of a class. In order to call a static method, the class name and method name are used, separated by a full stop (or period). 
It is important to understand that static methods may not directly use non-static members. It is invalid for one static method to directly call a non-static method or property without first instantiating an object. Similarly, private variables that are not marked as static cannot be utilised by a static method. The reverse of this is not true of course, as a non-static member can call a static method.
A static constructor is used to initialise the static state of a class when it is first used. This is similar to a standard constructor with some exceptions. A static constructor is always declared as private and as such may not be directly called by a program. A static constructor therefore has no facility to add parameters. It is also not possible to include a static destructor.
To add a static constructor, create a private constructor with the static keyword as a prefix. 

Polymorphism permits objects to behave in different ways according to the manner in which they are used. One part of polymorphism is the ability for a method to behave differently according to the types and number of parameters that are passed to it. This is achieved through method overloading.
In order to use overloaded methods, the signature must differ for each method declaration. This means that every overloaded method in a class must have either a different number of parameters or a different set of argument data types to every other method with the same name. However, the return type of the method is not included in this signature. This means that two methods that differ only in return type cannot be created in the same class.
Where parameters are passed by reference, they are considered to be different to those passed by value. This means that it is valid to have an overloaded method with the same set of parameter data types if one version passes parameters by value and the other by reference.
