Define a new class, called Car, which holds a single variable, called color. Use a color property to access the color variable.
Create a constructor for your Car class, which takes a parameter which allows us to initialize Car objects with a color. 
Also create the Describe() method, which prints out the colour of a Car.
Create several Car objects and assign different colours to them.

Sample Output:
The colour of this car is: Yellow
The colour of this car is: Red

class Car{
	
	private string _colour;
	
	public Car(string _c){//constructor
		//The "this" keyword can be used within a class's code to refer to the current instantiated object. 
		this._colour=_c;   //setting the underlying private variables in the constructor.
	}
	
	//properties
	public string colour{
		get{return _colour;}
		set{value =_colour;}

		Car Beetle = new Car ("Yellow");
		Car Porsche = new Car ("Red");
