Create a class Person, which has private field called age and a public method called Greet, which takes no arguments and returns a greeting. 
Create a class "Student" and another class "Teacher", both descendants of "Person". 
The class "Student" will have a public method "GoToClasses", which will write on screen "Iâ€™m going to class." 
The class "Teacher" will have a public method "Explain", which will show on screen "Explanation begins". Also, it will have a private attribute "subject", a string. 
The class Person must have a method "SetAge (int n)" which will indicate the value of their age (eg, 20 years old). 
The student will have a public method "ShowAge" which will write on the screen "My age is: 20 years old" (or the corresponding number). 
You must create another test class called "StudentAndTeacherTest" that will contain "Main" and: 
Create a Person and make it say hello 
Create a student, set his age to 21, tell him to Greet and display his age 
Create a teacher, 30 years old, ask him to say hello and then explain. 

Sample Output:
Hello
Hello
My age is: 21 years old
Hello
Explanation begins
