Create a class Person, which has an Age property and a public method called Greet, which takes no arguments and returns a greeting. 
The class Person must have a method "GetAge" which will indicate the value of their age (eg, 20 years old). 
Create a class "Student" and another class "Teacher", both descendants of "Person". 
The class "Student" will have a public method "GoToClasses", which will write on screen "Iâ€™m going to class." 
The class "Teacher" will have a public method "Explain", which will show on screen "Explanation begins". Also, it will have a private attribute "subject", a string. 

Create a Person and make it say hello 
Create a student, set his age to 21, tell him to Greet and display his age 
Create a teacher, 30 years old, ask him to say hello and then explain. 

Sample Output:
