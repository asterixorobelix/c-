Write a program which reads in the width and height (as doubles) of a  hole in the wall for a window.
The program should then print out the amount of wood required for the frame (in metres) and glass required to double glaze a window of that size.

Sample Output:
This program asks you for the width and height of a window and calculates the area of glass required to fill the hole
Enter width in metres:
2.3
Enter height in metres:
1.1
The length of the wood for the frame is: 6.8 metres
The area of glass required for double glazing is 5.06 square metres

Take any natural number n.

If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2.
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1.
Repeat the process indefinitely.
In 1937, Lothar Collatz proposed that no matter what number you begin with, the sequence eventually reaches 1. This is widely believed to be true, but has never been formally proved.

Write a program which inputs a number from the user, and then displays the Collatz Sequence starting from that number. 
Stop when you reach 1. It should also count the steps that it takes to get to 1.

Write a method to compute the distance between two points. Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the distance between these points is given by the formula:
d=((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2)^0.5

You must name the method distance, and it must return a decimal giving the distance between the two points.

Write a program which picks a random number from 1-100. The user keeps guessing as long as their guess is wrong, and they've guessed less than 7 times. 
If their guess is higher than the number, say "Too high" if their guess is lower than the number, say "Too low". 
When they get it right, the game stops. Or, if they hit seven guesses, the game stops even if they never got it right. 

I am thinking of a number between 1-100. You have 7 guesses:

Too high

Too low

Write a C# program which can be used to calculate the body mass index (BMI). This is commonly used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in populations.
BMI is computed by taking the individual's weight in kilograms and dividing it by the square of their height in meters. Output BMI to 4 decimal places, if decimals are non-zero. 
eg
Your Height in m: 1.75
Your Weight in kgs: 73
Your BMI is: 23.8367

Julio Cesar Chavez Mark VII is an interplanetary space boxer, who currently holds the championship belts for various weight categories on many different planets within our solar system. 
However, it is often difficult for him to recall what his "target weight" needs to be on earth in order to make the weight class on other planets. 
Write a program to help him keep track of this.

It should ask him what his earth weight is, and to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on. It should then compute his weight on the destination planet based on the table below:

#	Planet	Relative gravity
1	Venus	0.78
2	Mars	0.39
3	Jupiter	2.65
4	Saturn	1.17
5	Uranus	1.05
6	Neptune	1.23
So, for example, if Julio weighs 128 lbs. on earth, then he would weigh just under 50 lbs. on Mars, since Mars' gravity is 0.39 times earth's gravity. (128 * 0.39 is 49.92)


Our Input	Expected Output	
80 1		62.4
